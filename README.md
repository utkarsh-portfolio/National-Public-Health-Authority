Over#Overview
This R project analyzes a dataset of doctor visits, focusing on understanding factors influencing the number of medical consultations for patients over 65 years old. The analysis employs various machine learning techniques to predict and explore patterns in healthcare utilization.

This datasetâ€™s records represent seniors who responded to the NPHA survey.

The National Poll on Healthy Aging dataset was created to gather insights on the health, healthcare, and health policy issues affecting Americans aged 50 and older. By focusing on the perspectives of older adults and their caregivers, the University of Michigan aimed to inform the public, healthcare providers, policymakers, and advocates about the various aspects of aging. This includes topics like health insurance, household composition, sleep issues, dental care, prescription medications, and caregiving, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the health-related needs and concerns of the older population.
